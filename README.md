# Bootstrip

Bootstrip is a frontend component framework, based on a stripped-down version of Bootstrap 5. It emphasises minimal markup, code reuse, and developer-friendliness. It has BEM-like selectors. All components are written in Sass and Handlebars, and broken up to be easy to implement and refactor.
