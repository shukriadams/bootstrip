                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    Bootstrip is a frontend component library based on stripped-down Bootstrap 5. It has a strong emphasis on
                    minimal code and readability, and is aimed at programmers who want clean, functional, and easy-to-maintain frontend components in their projects. 
                    In many cases deliberate design compromises were made to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bootstrip allows for custom HTML elements, though these are entirely optional. One can write

<code class="code">&lt;x-columns class=&quot;--two&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/x-columns&gt;</code>

                    or

<code class="code">&lt;div class=&quot;columns --two&quot;&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;</code>

                    The main reason for the former is readability, and the benefits become more apparent as markup complexity increases. 
                </p>
                <h3>Block-Element-Modifier</h3>
                <p>
                    At its heart Bootstrip adheres to the spririt of BEM, with short/specific selectors and tight scoping of overrides, but the naming convention has been modified for brevity.
                </p>
